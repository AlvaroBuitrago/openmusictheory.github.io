## Compound period ##

The compound period (also called the *16-bar period* because its typical form is 16 bars long) is made of *two themes* instead of *two phrases*. Like an [8-bar period](period.html), the two halves of the compound period exhibit [antecedent](themeFunctions.html#antecedent) and [consequent](themeFunctions.html#consequent) function.

The thematic types available to the two halves of the compound period must be conducive to the functions of antecedent and consequent:
<ul>
	<li>the initiating phrase of the first theme will act as a basic idea, and the concluding half as a contrasting idea with a weak cadence;</li>
	<li>the initiating phrase of the second theme should bring back the BI from the first theme, and its concluding CI will end with a strong cadence.</li>
</ul>  

These functional requirements tend to result in only two types of compound period. 

###A Compound Period Comprised of Two Sentences

Both sentences in the compound period will have the same basic idea, each exhibiting presentation function. In the first sentence, the presentation is followed by a continuation that ends with a weak cadence. In the second, the continuation culminates in a strong cadence, most commonly a PAC.

The initiating phrase is constructed as a sentence whose basic idea is a presentation and whose contrasting idea is a continuation. Following the HC in m. 8, the next phrase restates the presentational basic idea in varied form. The final four measures culminate in a PAC.

## Compound sentence ##

The compound (or 16-bar) sentence expands both the presentation and continuation phrases of a regular [sentence](sentence.html) to a typical length of eight bars each. 

Each (2-bar) basic idea (BI) of the presentation phrase is replaced by a (4-bar) compound basic idea (CBI) in the expanded presentation. The resulting (typically 8-bar) presentation still has no cadence, but simply prolongs tonic.

The expanded continuation phrase is somewhat looser in proportion and in length. A "typical" continuation in this theme would have approximately four bars of continuation function followed by four bars of cadential function (an expanded cadential progression).

A prototypical example of a compound sentence is Mozart's [Trio for Piano, Clarinet, and Viola, K. 498](http://erato.uvt.nl/files/imglnks/usimg/3/32/IMSLP65681-PMLP133432-Mozart_Werke_Breitkopf_Serie_17_KV498_Piano.pdf), I., mm. 1–16.

Note that *bar length is not the important issue* when deciding whether a theme is a regular sentence or a compound sentence. Sometimes a regular sentence is written down in a fast duple meter, and it takes up 16 bars. At other times, a compound theme is set to such a slow tempo that it takes only 8 bars (like the compound period in Mozart's K. 332, above). The key difference between the regular sentence and the compound sentence is that the regular sentence begins with two basic ideas and the compound sentence begins with two *compound basic ideas*. Even that distinction will, at times, seem like splitting hairs, though at other times it will be quite obvious. Use your best judgment based on the musical features that you find to be the most salient.
