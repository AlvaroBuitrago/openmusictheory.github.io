================

Often, a theme is surrounded by material that exists outside its boundaries, but which is clearly dependent on the theme itself. This function of this material is, as William Caplin has noted, is “before-the-beginning,” what he calls an *introductory* (prefix) function, or “after-the-end," a *post-cadential* (suffix) function.

## Introduction ##

An introduction is a passage—a single chord, a few measures of accompanimental setup—preceding a theme. Introductions lack distinct motivic material and/or a harmonic progression. Therefore, these passage seem connected to the following theme, but when removed, do not disturb the logic of the phrase itself.

Here, a one-measure accompanimental introduction sits in front of a four-measure antecedent phrase, which begins in m. 2. As is common, this introduction lacks characteristic melodic interest—in fact, there is no melody at all—and simply repeats a tonic chord. The essential character of an introduction is of "setting up" the theme that follows.

##Post-Cadential Function##

The function of a post-cadential passage is described according to what kind of cadence—PAC or HC—ended the theme.

*Closing sections,* sometimes called *codettas*, follow themes that end with PACs. They are variable in length. A closing section functions to confirm the PAC that ended the theme by extending the theme's closing harmony.

In this example (from Mozart's Piano Sonata, K. 330), a [compound period](compoundThemes.html) initiates the theme and ends with a PAC in m. 16. Following the PAC, a five-measure *closing section* confirms the cadence. Notice that the melody is centered around scale degree 1—a common feature of these passages—and that harmonically the ii–V-I cadential progression that ended the theme (see m. 15 and 16) is simply repeated.

When post-cadential function follows an HC, it is called *standing on the dominant*. These passages are often signals for thematic entrances or thematic returns.

This famous example (from the first movement of Mozart’s Symphony No. 40) begins with a one-measure introduction followed a [compound sentence](compoundThemes.html). This compound sentence ends with a half cadence in m. 16. (Notice the augmented sixth chord that precedes it.) The succeeding measures *stand on the dominant,* prolonging the cadence by emphasizing dominant harmony with scale degree 5 embellished melodically.
