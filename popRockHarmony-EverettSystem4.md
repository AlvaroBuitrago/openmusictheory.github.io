title: Blues-based pop/rock tonality
---

Modern pop/rock owes a great debt to the blues. This "tonal system" includes not only songs that are explicitly based on a 12- or 16-bar blues progression, but also songs that exhibit harmonic structures that have grown out of those patterns—most notably the prominence of **V–IV–I** in recent rock.

For blues-based rock examples, see the [blues progression](popRockHarmony-blues.html) resource.
