Hybrid themes mixes the [functional features](themeFunctions.html) of [sentences](sentence.html) and [periods](period.html). William Caplin has identified four primary types: 

## Hybrid 1 ##

Hybrid 1 combines an [antecedent phrase](themeFunctions.html#antecedent) with a [continuation phrase](themeFunctions.html#continuation).

<!--This results in a complete presentation–continuation–cadential function progression in the antecedent phrase followed by an incomplete continuation–cadential function progression. On the large scale, the antecedent phrase functions like a big presentation function zone (like the presentation phrase does).-->

A prototypical example is found in the first eight measures of Mozart's Piano Sonata in C major, II. The antecedent phrase contains a basic idea characterized by the repeated notes forming its anacrusis. This is followed by a contrasting idea formed from a scalar ascent leading to the phrase's half cadence. Following the antecedent phrase, the music begins to express continuation function, primarily through fragmentation and an increase in surface rhythm. The fragmentation uses the repeated notes from the antecedent's basic idea that is liquidated into conventional scalar figuration approaching the cadence.

## Hybrid 2 ##

Hybrid 2 combines an antecedent phrase with a four-measure cadential progression.

</figure>

Here, the four measures subsequent to the antecedent support a single cadential progression: 

> **I6 ii6/5 V I**  

Notice that this four-measure phrase does not display any markers of [continuation function](themeFunctions.html#continuation). 

## Hybrid 3 ##

Hybrid 3 is almost identical to Hybrid 1, with the exception that the first phrase does not end with a cadence. This "compound basic idea" (CBI) presents the melodic structure of an antecedent (two contrasting melodic ideas), but uses the harmonic structure of a presentation phrase (tonic prolongation). The CBI expresses presentation function, followed by a continuation phrase that expresses continuation and cadential functions.

A prototypical example can be found in Haydn's Piano Sonata in C major, Hob. XVI:35, I., mm. 1–8.

## Hybrid 4 ##

Hybrid 4 is almost identical to a period, with the exception that the first phrase does not end with a cadence. The CBI expresses presentation function, which is picked up in the beginning of the consequent phrase that contains the basic idea, and possibly tonic harmony, as well. Continuation and cadential function do not appear until the last contrasting idea (CI).

A prototypical example can be found in Beethoven's String Quartet in G major, Op. 18/2, IV., mm. 1–8.
