<h1 id="keyboard-style-voice-leading-schemata">Keyboard-style voice-leading schemata</h1>

<p>Following are a number of <em>schemata</em> for keyboard-style voice-leading. Some of these are patterns that are common enough to warrant special attention (and memorization). Others require non-default voice-leading or doublings. In any case, these are worth memorizing to assist both in composition/arranging and in recognition of standard patterns. (Some will also come in handy for chorale-style voice-leading.)</p>

<h2 id="voice-exchange">Voice exchange</h2>

<p>A <em>voice exchange</em> occurs when the melody and bass lines exchange pitches over the course of a simple contrapuntal prolongation. For example, in the progression <strong>T1 D2 T3</strong>, the bass begins on <em>do</em> and ends on <em>mi</em>. In a voice exchange, the melody would reverse this, starting on <em>mi</em> and ending on <em>do</em>. This common pattern can use a <strong>V<sup>6/4</sup></strong>, <strong>V<sup>4/3</sup></strong>, or a <strong>VII<sup>6/3</sup></strong> chord for <strong>D2</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/VE64.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/VE63.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Using this voice exchange pattern will ensure smooth voice-leading throughout the prolongation.</p>

<p>Note that the <em>fa</em> in the <strong>D2</strong> passing chord (a functional dissonance) of the second example does <em>not</em> resolve down to <em>mi</em>. This is permissible because <em>mi</em> is required of the bass line but cannot be doubled, and because the smooth outer-voice counterpoint and stepwise inner-voice motion counteract any harshness perceived by the unresolved dissonance.</p>

<p>The voice exchange can also be used with a <strong>D4</strong> substitution chord. Note that the upper voices will be exactly the same as using a **V<sup>6/4<sup>** for <strong>D2</strong>.</sup></sup></p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/D4i.png" alt="" /> </p>

<p>These patterns can be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and the <strong>D2</strong> voice exchanges can be used in reverse, as well—<strong>T3 D2 T1</strong>. They can also be used to prolong S and D: <strong>S4 T5 S6</strong> or <strong>D5 S6 D7</strong>, for example.</p>

<h2 id="parallel-tenths">Parallel tenths</h2>

<p><em>Do–re–mi</em> in the bass is also frequently accompanied by <em>mi–fa–sol</em> in the melody, making <em>parallel tenths</em>.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/ParallelTenths.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Note here that, like the <em>fa</em> in the <strong>D2</strong> voice exchange, the <em>fa</em> in the melody is an unresolved functional dissonance. In this case, the voice leading once again is so smooth that it overrides the need for the functional dissonance to resolve.</p>

<p>This pattern can also be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and in reverse. It almost always uses a <strong>V<sup>4/3</sup></strong> for <strong>D2</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="champagne-progression">Champagne progression</h2>

<p>While <strong>T(1 D2p 3)</strong> is a perfectly acceptable way to accompany <em>mi–fa–sol</em> in the melody, a more interesting (and also more involved) way to harmonize that melody is what theorist Gene Biringer called the <em>champagne progression</em>: <strong>T1 S6 T3</strong>. (He called it this because it is “the progression you use when you want to impress a date.”)</p>

<p>The champagne progression is very nice, but must be treated carefully. <em>Only</em> use it with <em>mi–fa–sol</em> (or <em>me–fa–sol</em>) in the melody, and <em>always</em> use the following voice-leading (note the non-standard doubling of the bass—<em>la</em>/<em>le</em>—in the <strong>S6</strong> chord).</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/Champagne.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The standard champagne progression (above) uses a <strong>I<sup>6</sup></strong> chord for <strong>T3</strong>. Following is a variant using <strong>III</strong> for <strong>T3</strong>, which Biringer dubbed “pink champagne,” because it is especially nice. It should also be especially <em>rare</em>, or it loses its punch. </p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/PinkChampagne.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The champagne progression should only be used to prolong tonic function.</p>

<h2 id="deceptive-resolution">Deceptive resolution</h2>

<p>A <em>deceptive resolution</em> occurs When a <strong>D5</strong> (<strong>V</strong> or <strong>V<sup>7</sup></strong>) chord does not progress, as expected, to <strong>I</strong>  to form an authentic cadence, but instead progresses to <strong>VI</strong>. In the deceptive resolution, it is important for <em>ti</em> to resolve to <em>do</em>—as it would in an authentic cadence—not <em>la</em>/<em>le</em>. This fulfills its role as a tendency tone, helps the “deception” to work, and avoids the dissonant augmented second <em>ti</em>–<em>le</em> in minor. This results in a non-standard doubling of VI (<em>do</em>, rather than the bass).</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/deceptive.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/deceptive7.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="leaving-out-the-fifth">Leaving out the fifth</h2>

<p>When <em>ti</em>–<em>do</em> appears in the melody of an authentic cadence involving <strong>V<sup>7</sup></strong>, it is impossible to fully voice both chords <em>and</em> resolve the functional dissonance.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/D5problem.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is imperative to resolve this functional dissonance, as that resolution is an important contributor to the goal-oriented motion and the releasing of harmonic tension into the cadential arrival. In order to do so, either leave out the fifth of the <strong>I</strong> chord (and triple the bass):</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/T1dropFifth.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>or leave out the fifth of the <strong>V<sup>7</sup></strong> chord, and double the bass:</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/D5dropFifth.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The incomplete <strong>V<sup>7</sup></strong> is preferable to the incomplete <strong>I</strong>, but voice-leading into the <strong>V<sup>7</sup></strong> will usually dictate which option you choose.</p>

<h2 id="leaving-out-the-third">Leaving out the third</h2>

<p>When an <strong>S4</strong> progresses into a <strong>D5</strong>, and both are <em>seventh chords</em>, it can be impossible to prepare and resolve the functional dissonances of both chords while fully voicing them.</p>

<p><img src="Graphics/harmony/S4problem.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Instead, leave <em>la</em>/<em>le</em> out of the <strong>S4</strong> chord and double the bass. This will retain the trigger and bass note <em>fa</em>, as well as the two pitches making the dissonance (<em>do</em> and <em>re</em> or <em>mi</em>/<em>me</em> and <em>fa</em>), and will allow a second <em>fa</em> in an upper voice that can prepare the seventh of the <strong>D5</strong> chord.</p>
