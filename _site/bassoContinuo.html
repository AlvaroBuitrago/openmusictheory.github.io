<h1 id="composing-in-basso-continuo-style">Composing in basso-continuo style</h1>

<p><em>Basso continuo</em> (It. for “continuous bass” or “thoroughbass”) is essentially a chordal version of first-species counterpoint. However, instead of composing a single line above a cantus firmus, one composes a succession of chords (performed in the right hand) above a bass line (performed in the left hand). <em>Basso continuo</em> writing, also referred to as <em>realizing a figured bass</em>, gives no consideration to melody, only to the use of proper chords and the smoothest voice-leading possible. Thus, <em>basso continuo</em> style is a simple place to begin engaging the “fundamental musical problems” that arise when more than two lines are combined. </p>

<h3 id="chord-voicing">Chord voicing</h3>

<p>In strict keyboard-style writing, there are four voices: the bass line (which is usually a given in <em>basso continuo</em> style), and three <em>upper voices</em>: the <em>melody</em> or <em>soprano</em>, the <em>alto</em>, and the <em>tenor</em> (from highest to lowest). Since all three upper voices must be played by a single hand, they should never span more than an octave.</p>

<p>When choosing the notes to place in the upper voices above a figured bass, use the bass and figures to determine the pitch classes present in the chord. (When realizing an <em>unfigured bass</em>, you must determine appropriate figures before realizing.) If the chord is a four-note chord, use each chord member once, including the bass (exceptions will be noted later). If a chord has three pitch-classes (a triad, for instance), use each pitch-class once, and “double” one of them according to the following principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the figure is 6/4, 5/3, or other chord of the fifth, double the bass pitch class.  </li>
  <li>If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a <em>fixed scale degree</em> (<em>do</em>, <em>re</em>, <em>fa</em>, or <em>sol</em>), double the bass pitch class.  </li>
  <li>If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a <em>variable scale degree</em> (<em>mi</em>/<em>me</em>, <em>la</em>/<em>le</em>, or <em>ti</em>/<em>te</em>) or a chromatically altered pitch, double one of the upper voices at the octave or unison.  </li>
  <li>Generally, do not double a variable scale degree or a chromatically altered pitch.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <em>basso continuo</em> style, if the chord is properly voiced (correct pitch classes and correct doublings), two key principles of voice-leading will ensure good counterpoint between the voices most of the time:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>The law of the shortest way</em> (a term coined by composer Arnold Schoenberg): move each voice as little as possible. Prefer repetition to steps, steps to leaps, and one leap at a time to several voices leaping at the same time.  </li>
  <li><em>Move the right hand in contrary or oblique motion to the bass.</em> When the bass leaps by fourth or fifth, though, this rule can be ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, these rules cannot be followed absolutely (such as when a functional dissonance must be resolved, or when a melody makes it impossible—two cases to be considered later). In all cases, observe the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No parallel fifths or octaves between any pair of voices.  </li>
  <li>No contrary fifths or octaves between outer voices.  </li>
  <li>Do not approach an octave between the outer voices by similar motion unless the melody moves by step. (All other direct/hidden fifths and octaves are permissible.)</li>
</ul>
