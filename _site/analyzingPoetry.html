<h1 id="analyzing-poetry">Analyzing poetry</h1>

<p><em>This resource created by Jonathan Sircy, Department of English, Charleston Southern University.</em></p>

<h1 id="what-is-poetry">What is poetry?</h1>

<p>We can distinguish <em>poetry</em> from <em>prose</em> by its</p>

<ul>
  <li>preference for formal organization,  </li>
  <li>intensely conveyed emotions and images,  </li>
  <li>and concentrated use of language.</li>
</ul>

<p>Poetry favors the concrete and particular over the vague and abstract. Poetic language isn’t disconnected from normal communication. Rather, it conveys ideas and emotions with greater precision than everyday language.</p>

<h1 id="how-can-we-analyze-poetry">How can we analyze poetry?</h1>

<p>There are several ways to skin the poetic cat. What follows are four large categories with accompanying questions that can help us systematically interpret a poem. Not only are these categories not mutually exclusive, they are often complementary.</p>

<h3 id="structure">STRUCTURE:</h3>

<p>If we pay attention to a particular poem’s meter, tone, imagery, and figurative language, we are able to talk about a poem’s <em>unity</em>. This attention to structure starts from the premise that each of the poem’s parts work together organically (rather than, say, mechanically) to achieve a unified goal. If we were to put that goal into a single sentence, we would have the poem’s <em>theme</em>, a succinct statement of the poem’s central idea and emotions.</p>

<p><strong>Chief question: What idea or emotion UNIFIES the poem’s different parts?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Key terms: meter, tone, imagery, figurative language</strong></p>

<p><em>Meter</em>: the pattern of accented and unaccented syllables in a given poetic line<br />
<em>Tone</em>: the speaker’s attitude toward his subject, audience, or himself<br />
<em>Imagery</em>: the poetic representation of any sense experience<br />
<em>Figurative language</em>: the non-literal use of language to achieve an effect</p>

<h3 id="historical-context">HISTORICAL CONTEXT:</h3>

<p>When we pay attention to a poem’s structure, we pretend that it is an artifact that can be separated from the outside world. But every literary work had an author and an audience, and both are deeply influenced by a particular place and time. This not only affects the way we read poetic allusions but the way we interpret particular words.</p>

<p><strong>Chief Question: How do the poem’s words reflect the cultural context of the author and/or poet?</strong></p>

<h3 id="intertextuality">INTERTEXTUALITY:</h3>

<p>Poems aren’t just in conversation with history. They’re in conversation with other poems. This means that a literary work—in its form and/or content—resembles other literary works. When we focus on formal similarities, we’re concerned with genres, the different types or subcategories a poet has chosen (e.g. epic, lyric, satire). When we focus on similar content, we are either discussing <em>allusions</em>—intended references to another literary image—or <em>archetypes</em>, images or characters that appear so frequently they are less the domain of one author than part of a common literary heritage.</p>

<p><strong>Chief question: How is this literary work like/unlike other literary works?</strong></p>

<h3 id="ethics">ETHICS:</h3>

<p>Every poem interprets life and thus, explicitly or implicitly, provides us with a view of the world. Defenders of poetry have long maintained that poetry is uniquely able to delight AND instruct; in fact, it often instructs BY delighting. That means every literary work presents actions/beliefs for us to applaud or denounce. This is often the most difficult thing to interpret about a particular work of art, and we must keep in mind that a work may present objectionable actions or beliefs in order to criticize them.</p>

<p><strong>Chief question: What actions or beliefs does the poem support?</strong></p>
