<h1>Performing a harmonic analysis</h1>

<p>Analyzing harmony in a piece or passage of music involves more than labeling chords. Even the most basic analysis also involves <em>interpreting</em> the way that specific chords and progressions function within the context of a phrase. Ultimately, no analysis is complete until individual musical elements are interpreted in light of the work as a whole and the historical setting in which the piece occurs. But this resource simply walks through the steps of performing a basic harmonic analysis, interpreting each chord and chord progression in light of the musical phrase in which it occurs.</p>

<p>The first step in a harmonic analysis is to <em>identify phrases</em>. For the most part, that means beginning by identifying <a href="cadenceTypes.html"><em>cadences</em></a>. However, not every type of phrase ends with a cadence, so sensitivity to theme types is important. In classical isntrumental music, that means listening for <a href="classicalThemes.html">period- and sentence-like structures</a>. In classical or romantic music with text, that means listening in particular for the ends of poetic lines and melodic phrases.</p>

<p>Once you have identified the musical phrases, perform a thoroughbass reduction (bass line with figures above) of each phrase. Below the bass line, write an uninterpreted functional bass symbol for each chord (<strong>T1 T3 S4</strong> etc.).</p>

<p>Next identify the general harmonic structure of each phrase. Typical phrases in classical music will do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>prolong tonic without a cadence (a classical <em>presentation</em> phrase, for example)</li>
<li>progress toward an authentic cadence (ending with <strong>D5 T1</strong> or <strong>V<sup>(7)</sup> I</strong>)</li>
<li>progress toward a half cadence (ending with <strong>D5</strong> or <strong>V<sup>(7)</sup></strong>)</li>
</ul>


<p>If the phrase prolongs tonic, the <em>entire</em> phrase should be placed within parentheses or curly brackets.</p>

<p>If the phrase ends with a cadence, identify the <em>cadential progression</em>. This includes the last chord of the tonic zone, optionally followed by a subdominant chord or zone (most often a single chord), and a required dominant zone (most often a single chord or compound cadence formula). Half-cadence phrases end there. Authentic-cadence phrases continue on to a final tonic zone (usually a singe chord). The <strong>(S) D T</strong> of the cadential progression will always stand on its own as a functional progression, and should never be placed in parentheses or brackets indicating tonic prolongation.</p>

<p>Once the cadential progression is identified, everything before it should be analyzed as tonic prolongation: either parentheses for contrapuntal prolongations or curly brackets for subsidiary progressions. Keep in mind that every non-tonic chord inside those parentheses should have a postscript ("n" for neighbor chord, "p" for passing chord, etc., according to the pattern of the bass voice).</p>
