<h1 id="harmonic-syntax---prolongation">Harmonic syntax - prolongation</h1>

<h1 id="triggering-and-prolonging-harmonic-functions-in-an-idealized-phrase">Triggering and prolonging harmonic functions in an idealized phrase</h1>

<p>To establish, or trigger, a harmonic functional zone, <em>a fixed scale degree must appear in the bass</em>. In other words, tonic can be triggered by <strong>T1</strong> (always <strong>I</strong>), subdominant by <strong>S2</strong> or <strong>S4</strong> (including a variety of <strong>II</strong> and <strong>IV</strong> chords, in inversions, with and without sevenths), and dominant by <strong>D5</strong> (<strong>V</strong>, with or without a seventh, or any initial chord of a <em>compound cadence</em>). These are called <em>functional chords</em> (because they trigger the function) or <em>cadential chords</em> (because they can participate in a cadence). Other chords are called <em>contrapuntal chords</em>, and are used to <em>prolong</em> a function throughout the zone.</p>

<p>Functional prolongations are shown in a harmonic analysis by writing/typing T, S, or D underneath the individual chord labels (Roman numerals or functional bass) and extending a line from the beginning of the functional zone to the end.</p>

<p><strong><em>insert graphic example</em></strong></p>

<p>Such an analysis is called an <em>interpreted</em> harmonic analysis, because the harmonies are interpreted according to the way they behave in the phrase, rather than merely labeled. </p>

<p>Following are the primary techniques used to prolong functional zones in an idealized classical phrase. Examples of specific progressions and notational conventions are provided.</p>

<h2 id="change-of-figure-prolongation">Change-of-figure prolongation</h2>

<p>A <em>change-of-figure prolongation</em> occurs when the bass repeats (or is sustained, or drops an octave) while one or more of the upper voices change. </p>

<p>Examples include progressions like <strong>V–V<sup>7</sup></strong> (both <strong>D5</strong>) or <strong>IV–II<sup>6</sup></strong> (both <strong>S4</strong>). </p>

<h2 id="change-of-bass-prolongation">Change-of-bass prolongation</h2>

<p>A <em>change-of-bass prolongation</em> occurs when two chords of the same function appear back-to-back, but with different bass pitch classes. In some cases, these are changes of inversion: <strong>I–I<sup>6</sup></strong>, for example. In other cases, the root changes: <strong>I–III</strong> or <strong>IV–II</strong>, for example. What makes these progressions prolongations is that the function remains the same. <strong>I–I<sup>6</sup></strong> prolongs tonic function (<strong>T1–T3</strong>), and <strong>IV–II</strong> prolongs subdominant function (<strong>S4–S2</strong>).</p>

<h2 id="contrapuntal-prolongation--passing-chord">Contrapuntal prolongation – passing chord</h2>

<p>Many change-of-bass prolongations involve a skip of a third in the bass, such as <strong>I–I<sup>6</sup></strong> (<strong>T1–T3</strong>). Just as in second-species counterpoint a melodic third from downbeat to downbeat invites the use of a weak-beat passing tone, a melodic third in the bass between these two chords invites the use of a <em>passing chord</em>.</p>

<p>The bass note of a passing chord will fill in the third with stepwise motion. The melody will also often contain passing motion.</p>

<p>A function is typically prolonged by contrapuntal chords belonging to the function that precedes it in the standard cycle. T is prolonged by D, D by S, and S by T.</p>

<p>A passing chord that prolongs the above <strong>T1–T3</strong> progression would then be a dominant chord (D precedes T) with scale-degree 2 in the bass (the passing tone between scale degrees 1 and 3): <strong>D2</strong>. Common <strong>D2</strong> chords are <strong>V6/4</strong>, <strong>V4/3</strong>, and <strong>VII6</strong>. Thus, a <strong>I–I<sup>6</sup></strong> prolongation can involve those as passing chords. </p>

<p>Note that while sacle-degree 2 in the bass can support a <strong>II</strong> chord, <strong>II</strong> is subdominant, and so it is <em>not</em> used as a passing chord to prolong tonic.</p>

<h2 id="contrapuntal-prolongation--incomplete-neighbor-chord">Contrapuntal prolongation – incomplete neighbor chord</h2>

<p>In second-species counterpoint, variety could come by using a <em>substitution</em> in place of a passing tone. This leap of a fourth followed by step in the opposite direction still outlines a third from downbeat to downbeat, but offers a break from too much stepwise motion in the counterpoint.</p>

<p>In harmonic writing, the same effect is obtained by an <em>incomplete neighbor chord</em>. The bass follows the same pattern as the second-species counterpoint, and the function of the contrapuntal chord is the same as its passing-chord counterpart. Thus instead of a passing motion of <strong>T1 D2 T3</strong>, a substitution pattern in the bass would produce <strong>T1 D4 T3</strong>. (In Roman numerals, that progression would almost invariably be <strong>I V<sup>4/2</sup> I<sup>6</sup></strong>.)</p>

<h2 id="contrapuntal-prolongation--complete-neighbor-chord">Contrapuntal prolongation – complete neighbor chord</h2>

<p>Just as a <em>neighbor tone</em> in second- or third-species counterpoint could be used to ornament a single tone and return to it, a <em>neighbor chord</em> uses a neighbor-tone motion in the bass to prolong a function and return to the original bass pitch. The function of a neighbor chord follows the same principle as the passing or incomplete neighbor chord. Following are some examples of neighbor-chord prolongations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>T1 D7 T1</strong>  </li>
  <li><strong>T3 D4 T3</strong>  </li>
  <li><strong>S4 T3 S4</strong>  </li>
  <li><strong>D7 S6 D7</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Just as third-species counterpoint has a <em>double neighbor</em> figure, harmonies can be prolonged by two chords using a double-neighbor figure in the bass. The most common double-neighbor prolongation is <strong>T1 D2 D7 T1</strong> (commonly <strong>I V4/3 V6/5 I</strong>).</p>

<h2 id="contrapuntal-prolongation---divider-and-embellishing-chords">Contrapuntal prolongation - divider and embellishing chords</h2>

<p>In second-species counterpoint, an <em>interval subdivision</em> divided a large leap between downbeats into two smaller leaps. Likewise, a <em>divider chord</em> takes a large leap between bass notes in a change-of-bass prolongation (or a simple octave leap in the bass) and divides it into two smaller leaps.</p>

<p>Divider chords almost always prolong tonic function, and can do so using either subdominant or dominant dividers. The most common divider-chord prolongations are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>T1 D5 T1</strong> (<strong>I V<sup>(7)</sup> I</strong>), where the bass ascends or descends an octave between <strong>T1</strong> chords.  </li>
  <li><strong>T1 S4 T1</strong> (<strong>I IV I</strong>), where the bass ascends or descends an octave between <strong>T1</strong> chords.  </li>
  <li><strong>T1 S6 T3</strong> (<strong>I IV<sup>6</sup> I<sup>6</sup></strong> or <strong>I IV<sup>6</sup> III</strong>), dubbed the <em>champagne progression</em> by theorist Gene Biringer, because it is “the progression you pull out when you want to impress a date.” This progression is listed in the <em>harmonic schemata</em> resource, because it typically follows a unique voice-leading pattern.  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of the first two progressions, the same harmonic progression can occur without the bass changing register. In other words, the bass leaps from <em>do</em> to <em>sol</em> or <em>fa</em>, but returns to the original bass note. Instead of dividing a large leap, the bass note of the intervening chord looks like an <em>embellishing tone</em> from third species. (In third-species counterpoint, an <em>embellishing tone</em> ornaments another tone by leaping to another consonance—usually a third or fourth away—and returning to the original tone.) Thus, what would otherwise be a <em>divider chord</em> is instead an <em>embellishing chord</em>. </p>

<h2 id="subsidiary-harmonic-progressions">Subsidiary harmonic progressions</h2>

<p>The last type of prolongation is not contrapuntal, but instead involves weak versions of the typical <strong>T–(S)–D–T</strong> progression. When such a progression fails to produce a proper cadence—that is, it ends with contrapuntal chords such as <strong>D7–T1</strong> or <strong>D4–T3</strong>, or uses a “deceptive resolution” <strong>D5–Tx6</strong> (<strong>V–VI</strong>) in place of the cadential <strong>D5–T1</strong>—the progression is called a <em>subsidiary harmonic progression</em> (this term comes from Edward Aldwell &amp; Carl Schachter; Steven Laitz calls the same progression an <em>embedded phrase model</em>). It is “subsidiary” (or “embedded”) because instead of occupying the whole phrase, it is subsidiary to (or embedded in) a larger progression. </p>

<p>These subsidiary progressions <em>always prolong tonic</em>. They are labeled in an analysis by following the initial T with a line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>T—————</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, consider the following possible harmonic progression for a phrase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>T1 S4 D4 T3 S4 D5 T1</strong><br />
(<strong>I IV V<sup>4/2</sup> I<sup>6</sup> II<sup>6</sup> V I</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first progression through the <strong>T–S–D–T</strong> cycle does not produce a cadence when it returns to T. However, it cannot be said to be a contrapuntal prolongation because it follows the normal functional cycle perfectly. Thus, it is a subsidiary progression. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I IV V<sup>4/2</sup> I<sup>6</sup> II<sup>6</sup> V I</strong><br />
<strong>T———— S D T</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="prolonging-a-progression">Prolonging a progression</h2>

<p>Occasionally, a contrapuntal chord is used not to prolong a single function, but to connect chords of different functions—in other words, to prolong a progression.</p>

<p>The most common occurrence is when a bass line moves down by step from <em>do</em> to <em>sol</em>, which is especially common in minor. The bass line <em>do</em>–<em>te</em>–<em>le</em>–<em>sol</em> is harmonized by <strong>T1 D7 S6 D5</strong> (usually <strong>i v<sup>6</sup> iv<sup>6</sup> V</strong>—the chord qualities are important in this progression, called the “lament”). In this progression, the <strong>S6</strong> is functional subdominant leading to the cadential <strong>D5</strong>. The <strong>D7</strong> chord, then, is simply a passing chord that connects <strong>T1</strong> with <strong>S6</strong>. To notate this, draw and arrow between <strong>T</strong> and <strong>S</strong>. </p>
