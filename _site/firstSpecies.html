<h1 id="composing-a-first-species-counterpoint">Composing a first-species counterpoint</h1>

<p>Counterpoint is the mediation of two or more musical <em>lines</em> into a meaningful and pleasing <em>whole</em>. In first-species counterpoint, we not only write a smooth melody that has its own integrity of shape, variety, and goal-directed motion, but we also write a second melody that contains these traits. Further, and most importantly, we combine these melodies to create a whole texture that is smooth, exhibits variety and goal-oriented motion, and in which these melodies both maintain their independence and fuse together into consonant <em>simultaneities</em> (the general term for two or more notes sounding at the same time).</p>

<p>In first species counterpoint, we begin with a <em>cantus firmus</em> (new or existing) and compose a single new line—called the <em>counterpoint</em>—above or below the cantus firmus. That new line contains one note for every note in the cantus: both the cantus firmus and the counterpoint will be all whole notes. Thus, first species is sometimes called one-against-one or 1:1 counterpoint.</p>

<h2 id="the-counterpoint-line">The counterpoint line</h2>

<p>In general, the counterpoint should follow the principles of <a href="cantusFirmus.html">writing a good cantus firmus</a>. There are some minor differences, to be discussed below, but generally a first-species counterpoint should consist of two cantus-firmus-quality lines.</p>

<h3 id="beginning-a-first-species-counterpoint">Beginning a first-species counterpoint</h3>

<p>To exemplify goal-oriented motion, the first-species exercise should begin and end with the most stable of sonorities: perfect consonances. Thus, when writing a counterpoint <em>above</em> a cantus firmus, the first note of the counterpoint should be <em>do</em> or <em>sol</em> (a P1, P5, or P8 above the cantus).</p>

<p>When writing a counterpoint <em>below</em> a cantus firmus, the first note of the counterpoint must always be <em>do</em> (P1 or P8 below the cantus). (Beginning on <em>sol</em> would create a dissonant fourth; beginning on <em>fa</em> would create a P5 but confuse listeners about the tonal context, since <em>fa–do</em> at the beginning of a piece is easily misheard as <em>do–sol</em>.)</p>

<h3 id="ending-a-first-species-counterpoint">Ending a first-species counterpoint</h3>

<p>The final note of the counterpoint must always be <em>do</em> (P1 or P8 above/below the cantus).</p>

<p>To approach this ending smoothly, with variety, and with strong goal orientation, always approach the final interval by contrary stepwise motion. If the cantus ends <em>re</em>–<em>do</em>, the counterpoint’s final two pitches should be <em>ti</em>–<em>do</em>. If the cantus ends <em>ti</em>–<em>do</em>, the counterpoint’s final two pitches should be <em>re</em>–<em>do</em>. Thus the penultimate bar will either be a minor third or a major sixth between the two lines. This is the case for both major and minor keys.</p>

<h3 id="independence-of-the-lines">Independence of the lines</h3>

<p>Like the cantus firmus, the counterpoint should have a single climax. To maintain the independence of the lines and the smoothness of the entire passage (so no one moment is hyper-emphasized by a double climax), these climaxes should not coincide.</p>

<p>A single repeat/tie in the counterpoint is allowed, but try to avoid repeating at all. This promotes variety in the exercise, since there are so few notes to begin with.</p>

<p>Avoid <em>voice crossing</em>, where the upper voice is temporarily lower than the lower voice, and <em>vice versa</em>. Voice crossings diminish the independence of the lines and make them more difficult to distinguish by ear.</p>

<p>Avoid <em>voice overlap</em>, where one voice leaps past the previous note of the other voice. For example, if the upper part sings an E4, the lower part cannot sing an F4 in the following bar. This also helps maintain the independence of the lines.</p>

<h3 id="intervals-and-motion">Intervals and motion</h3>

<p>The interval between the cantus and counterpoint at any moment should not exceed a perfect twelfth (octave plus fifth). In general, try to keep the two lines within an octave where possible, and only exceed a tenth in “emergencies,” and only briefly (one or two notes). When the voices are too far apart, tonal fusion is diminished. Further, it can diminish <em>performability</em>, which though not an essential principle of human cognition is an important consideration for composers, and it has a direct effect on the smoothness, melodic integrity, and tonal fusion of what listeners hear during a performance.</p>

<p>In general, all harmonic <em>consonances</em> are allowed. However, unisons should only be used for first and last intervals. Unisons are very stable, and serve best as goals rather than mid points. They also diminish the independence of the lines.</p>

<p><em>Imperfect consonances</em> are preferable to <em>perfect consonances</em> for all intervals other than the first and last dyads, in order to heighten the sense of arrival at the end, and to promote a sense of motion towards that arrival. In all cases, aim for a variety of harmonic intervals over the course of the exercise.</p>

<p><em>Never, ever, ever</em> use two perfect consonances of the same size in a row: <strong>P5–P5</strong> or <strong>P8–P8</strong>. This includes both simple and compound intervals. For example, <strong>P5–P12</strong> is considered the same as <strong>P5–P5</strong>. (Two different perfect consonances in a row, such as <strong>P8–P5</strong>, is allowed, however, but try to follow every perfect consonance with an imperfect consonance if possible.) These “parallel fifths and octaves” significantly promote tonal fusion over melodic independence at the same time that the consecutive stable sonorities arrest both the variety and the motion of the exercise. Thus, they are far from ideal, and to be avoided in species counterpoint.</p>

<p>Vary the types of motion between successive intervals (parallel, similar, contrary, oblique). Try to use all types of motion (except, perhaps, oblique motion), but prefer contrary motion where possible. It is best for preserving the independence of the lines, in addition to variety. </p>

<p>Because similar and parallel motion diminish variety and melodic independence, their use should be mediated by other factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not use more than three of the same imperfect consonance type in a row (e.g., three thirds in a row).  </li>
  <li><em>Never</em> move into a perfect consonance by similar motion (this is called <em>direct</em> or <em>hidden octaves</em>). This draws too much attention to an interval which already stands out of the texture.  </li>
  <li>Avoid combining similar motion with leaps, especially large ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>

<p>In the following video, I illustrate the process of composing a first-species counterpoint. This video provides new information about the compositional process, as well as concrete examples of the above rules and principles.</p>

<h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>

<p>Before composing a first-species exercise from scratch, try the following practice exercises. Each has one or two errors. Try to find the error(s), and recompose the exercise to create a well formed exercise. Be sure to listen to and perform the exercises, both as they are written, and as you make changes. Your ear may already be able to direct you to errors. If not, use the principles outlined above one-by-one to search for errors. Once you identify an error, be sure to listen several times, singing along with one line or the other, to train your ear to recognize the problem.</p>

<p><strong><em>Insert trinkets: one minor, one major, one above, one below, with errors</em></strong></p>
