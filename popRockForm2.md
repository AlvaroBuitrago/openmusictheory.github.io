## Strophic form (AAA)

A song form containing three or more formal cycles, where the formal cycle is {A}—that is, a single module exhibiting the function of a strophe. Auxiliary modules may also be present (I, O, J, or X). Strophic form is more common in early rock-and-roll (1950s–1960s) than in the 1970s and beyond. In Christian worship music, the influence of hymnody makes strophic form more common in contemporary music than in popular music (prominent examples include Keith & Kristyn Getty, Stuart Townend, and Bob Kauflin).

## 32-bar song form (AABA)

A song form containing at least one complete formal cycle of {AABA} (though typically two complete cycles or one complete cycle followed by a partial cycle). A is the primary module. Auxiliary modules may also be present. 

AABA form can be realized as AABA, AABA’, AA’BA’, or AA’BA’’. No matter the degree of alteration of the main strophe, if the general functional progression of AABA is present, it is 32-bar/AABA form. 32-bar/AABA form was most common prior to the advent of rock-and-roll and disappears almost entirely from the Billboard top-20 after the mid-1960s. It’s most typical appearance has two four-bar phrases per eight-bar module, making the typical complete cycle 32 bars long, hence the common name 32-bar song form.

## Verse-chorus form (VC, VCB)

A versatile song form that rapidly took over rock-and-roll in the 1960s and has dominated the genre ever since. A verse-chorus song’s formal cycle will contain at least two core modules—verse (V) and chorus (C), with the chorus module being the primary module. Other possible modules in the cycle exhibit prechorus (P), bridge (B), and postchorus (Z) functions. 

A full cycle containing all modules except for B would be {VPCZ}. These four functions always progress in this order, though not all need be present. Bridge modules are somewhat flexible. If a song has single bridge module, it tends to appear once, followed by the last chorus, or the last prechorus and chorus, of the song. Bridges often appear in place of the verse and/or prechorus modules in the last cycle, not as an extra element. Thus, songs that incorporate all five core module types rarely will place all five in a single cycle. 

Common non-bridge cycles include {VC}, {VPC}, and occasionally (especially as the first cycle in a song) {VVC}, with Z potentially added to the end of any. Common cycles including bridge are {BC} and {BPC}, with Z potentially added to the end of either.

## Simple verse-chorus form

A term coined by John Covach referring to songs in verse-chorus form where the harmonic progression underlying the verse is the same as that underlying the chorus.

## Super-simple verse-chorus form

A term coined by Jay Summach (based on Covach’s) referring to songs in verse-chorus form where the harmonic progression and the melody are both the same for verse and chorus (Summach, p. 322).
