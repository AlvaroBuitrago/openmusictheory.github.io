title: Beams and borrowed divisions

### Beams ###

It's important to remember that notation is intended to be read by performers. You should always strive to make your notation as easy to interpret as possible. Part of this includes grouping the rhythms such that they convey the beat unit and the beat division. *Beams* are used to group any notes at the beat division level or shorter that fall within the same beat. 

In this example, the eighth notes are not grouped with beams, making it difficult to interpret the triple meter.

In this example, the eighth notes within the same beat are grouped together with a beam. This makes it much easier for the performer to properly interpret the meter while reading the music.
