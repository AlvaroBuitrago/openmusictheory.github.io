***Add intro/explanation of the why and how it builds on shortest-way.***

## Tendency tones ##

*Ti* (not *te*) and *le* (not *la*) are *tendency tones*. 

Generally speaking, when *ti* appears in an upper voice of a dominant-functioning chord, it should be followed by *do* in the same voice upon change of function (to T or S).

Likewise, when *le* appears in an upper voice of a subdominant-functioning chord, it should be followed by *sol* in the same voice upon change of function.

Exceptions to these tendencies include:

- When *ti* is in the middle of a stepwise descent (*re*–*do*–*ti*–*la*–*sol*, for example), it can progress down by step.  
- When *ti* is in an inner voice, it can progress down to *sol* if necessary to accomplish good voice-leading in the other voices and ensure complete chords. This is called a *frustrated leading-tone*.  
- When *ti* is a functional dissonance of a tonic-functioning chord (see below) it should progress down by step.

## Functional dissonances ##

Following are the scale degrees which act as dissonances for their respective functions:

| function	| dissonances	|
| -: | :-: |
| T or Tx	| 7, 5 when 6 is also present	
| S	| 3, 1 when 2 is also present
| D	| 4, 6

When one of these scale degrees is present in a chord with the corresponding function, the dissonant scale degree should *resolve down by step over the next change in function*. In strict keyboard style, these functional dissonances should behave like one of the three dissonance types of species counterpoint: a *passing tone* or *neighbor tone* dissonance that is approached by step, or a *suspension* dissonance that is approached by a common tone. The suspension type is preferred.

Once a functional dissonance is introduced, it must be resolved down by step in the same voice when the function changes. The dissonance can also be *transferred* to another voice before resolution—for instance, if there are multiple chords in a row exhibiting the same function, a dissonance that appears in the alto can be transferred to the tenor in the following chord, and then resolve in the tenor when the function changes. (It is more typical, and smoother sounding, to transfer dissonances between inner voices or from an inner voice to an outer voice than from an outer voice to an inner voice. Once a dissonance appears in the melody or bass, it tends to resolve in that voice.)

Functional dissonance resolutions often cause conflicts with other principles of voice leading. Except in special cases such as *schemata* (standard patterns that are common enough to sound appropriate, even if they follow different rules), the functional dissonance resolution takes precedence over other principles such as the *law of the shortest way*, contrary motion with the bass, and preferring common tones and steps to melodic leaps. A dissonance resolution is never an excuse for illegal parallels, and only rarely can justify non-standard doublings.
