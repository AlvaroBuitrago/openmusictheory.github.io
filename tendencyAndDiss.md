***Add intro/explanation of the why and how it builds on shortest-way.***

In explaining musical styles, [Leonard Meyer](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3267613W/Style_and_music) divides musical characteristics into three categories: *laws*, *rules*, and *strategies*. Laws are characteristics of music that are based on human biology and psychology, and as a result laws are more-or-less universal. Rules are culturally conditioned. They are hallmarks of a particular style that are more-or-less universal within the style, but differ from style to style and culture to culture. Finally, strategies are specific ways in which composers work within a style—the things that make one composer's work sound different from another's, even if they compose in the same style.

For the most part, voice-leading principles are "rules" according to Meyer's definitions. They are specific to a style. Or, rather, in most cases, they are shared among a few styles of Western music, but are far from universal. Thus, it can be helpful to think of them as collective traits of some music(s) we seek to understand and emulate, rather than hard-and-fast *it-must-be-done-this-way* strictures for all musical practice.

However, as we saw in species counterpoint, these rules are related to laws, in as much as they represent one set of practices that mediate the various demands on music from basic principles of human auditory perception and cognition. For instance, the (relatively simple) prohibition against parallel fifths is a specific way in which Western tonal composers have mediated the conflict between tonal fusion, goal-directed motion, and independence of line. As we progress in our study of voice-leading, we will encounter more of these standard practices, or "rules."

Note, however, that while "avoid parallel fifths" takes on the form of what we consider "rules" in day-to-day speech, Meyer's rules of musical style are different. Meyer's rules are *descriptive*: these things tend to happen universally, frequently, rarely, never, in specific situations, etc. "Avoid parallel fifths" is a *prescriptive* instruction based on that descriptive observation: because parallel fifths occur rarely in this style, and only in specific cases, avoid them in your own strict-style compositions until we have a chance to engage those specific cases—all the while remembering that other styles may have different tendencies.

That word *tendencies* is an important one. There are rarely absolutes in the musical parameters we engage most as performers, analysts, composers, listeners, etc. The absolutes of common styles fell into our unconscious background long ago. Instead, what makes each piece, composer, or style special and unique—what we care about—are the little ways in which they bend the "rules," the ways in which they express, thwart, and play with the tendencies of the style they engage—the ways they play with our expectations as listeners.

Over time, as we familiarize ourselves with a musical style, the tendencies of the style become *expectations* in our mind, and composers can, in turn, compose with those listener expectations in mind. Though those tendencies are subjective, and to a large extent statistical, the shared stylistic knowledge and the shared psychological expectancy create a kind of quasi-objective language. That musical "language," like spoken/written languages, is both reliable and bendable/breakable. The meaningfulness of a piece of music is dependent on that reliability. But its specialness is dependent on the ability for the "rules" of that language to be bent, even broken.

With this in mind, as we progress in our study of voice-leading, we will encounter more exceptions to the prescriptive rules, even in strict-style composition, and our hard-and-fast strictures will transition more and more into the language of tendency.

We will begin with tendency tones. 

## Tendency tones ##

A *tendency tone* is a pitch (class)—usually represented as a scale degree—that tends to progress to some pitch classes more than others. Sometimes this tendency is absolute within a style, but more often it is context-dependent.

The most prominent tendency tones in Western tonal styles are *ti* (not *te*) and *le* (not *la*). 

Generally speaking, when *ti* appears it tends to be followed by *do* in the same voice. In a harmonic context, this tendency is strongest when *ti* occurs in a dominant-functioning chord, and the "resolution" of that tendency comes upon change of function (to tonic or subdominant).

Likewise, when *le* appears, it tends to be followed by *sol* in the same voice. This tendency is less dependent on function.

Exceptions to these tendencies include:

- When *ti* is in the middle of a stepwise descent (*re*–*do*–*ti*–*la*–*sol*, for example), it can progress down by step.  
- When *ti* is in an inner voice, it can progress down to *sol* if necessary to accomplish good voice-leading in the other voices and ensure complete chords. This is called a *frustrated leading-tone*.  
- When *ti* is a functional dissonance of a tonic-functioning chord (see below) it should progress down by step.

## Functional dissonances ##

Following are the scale degrees which act as dissonances for their respective functions:

| function	| dissonances	|
| -: | :-: |
| T or Tx	| 7, 5 when 6 is also present	
| S	| 3, 1 when 2 is also present
| D	| 4, 6

When one of these scale degrees is present in a chord with the corresponding function, the dissonant scale degree should *resolve down by step over the next change in function*. In strict keyboard style, these functional dissonances should behave like one of the three dissonance types of species counterpoint: a *passing tone* or *neighbor tone* dissonance that is approached by step, or a *suspension* dissonance that is approached by a common tone. The suspension type is preferred.

Once a functional dissonance is introduced, it must be resolved down by step in the same voice when the function changes. The dissonance can also be *transferred* to another voice before resolution—for instance, if there are multiple chords in a row exhibiting the same function, a dissonance that appears in the alto can be transferred to the tenor in the following chord, and then resolve in the tenor when the function changes. (It is more typical, and smoother sounding, to transfer dissonances between inner voices or from an inner voice to an outer voice than from an outer voice to an inner voice. Once a dissonance appears in the melody or bass, it tends to resolve in that voice.)

Functional dissonance resolutions often cause conflicts with other principles of voice leading. Except in special cases such as *schemata* (standard patterns that are common enough to sound appropriate, even if they follow different rules), the functional dissonance resolution takes precedence over other principles such as the *law of the shortest way*, contrary motion with the bass, and preferring common tones and steps to melodic leaps. A dissonance resolution is never an excuse for illegal parallels, and only rarely can justify non-standard doublings.
