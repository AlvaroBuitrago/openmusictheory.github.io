title: Composing a cantus firmus
---

{{ page.title }}
================

Exercises in strict voice-leading, or species counterpoint, begin with a single, well formed musical line called the *cantus firmus* (fixed voice, or fixed melody; pl. *cantus firmi*). *Cantus firmus* composition gives us the opportunity to engage the following fundamental musical traits:

- smoothness  
- independence and integrity or melodic lines  
- variety  
- motion (towards a goal)

Our first exercises in strict voice-leading will be to compose good, well formed *cantus firmi*. The first step is to perform and analyze model *cantus firmi*, such as the following *cantus firmus* in C major, composed by Heinrich Schenker.

A number of others are provided [here][CFs]. Performing these is a helpful practice to develop an internal sense of the sound and feel of a well formed *cantus*, and many of the characteristics of well formed *cantus firmi* carry over into other musical styles. (These model *cantus firmi* can also be used as the starting points for our two-voice exercises.)

From these *cantus*, notice how the general musical characteristics of smoothness, melodic integrity, variety, and motion towards a goal are worked out in specific characteristics. The following characteristics are typical of all well formed *cantus firmi*:

- length of about 8–16 notes  
- arhythmic (all whole notes; no long or short notes)  
- begin and end on *do*  
- approach final tonic by step (usually *re*–*do*, sometimes *ti*–*do*)  
- all note-to-note progressions are melodic consonances  
- range (interval between lowest and highest notes) of no more than a tenth, usually less than an octave  
- a single climax (high point) that appears only once in the melody  
- clear logical connection and smooth shape from beginning to climax to ending  
- mostly stepwise motion, but with some leaps (mostly small leaps)  
- no repetition of "motives" or "licks"  
- any large leaps (fourth or larger) are followed by step in opposite direction  
- no more than two leaps in a row; no consecutive leaps in the same direction (Fux's F-major *cantus* is an exception, where the back-to-back descending leaps outline a consonant triad.)  
- the leading tone progresses to the tonic  
- in minor, the leading tone only appears in the penultimate bar; the raised submediant is only used when progressing to that leading tone

## Practice exercise 

Before composing a *cantus firmus* from scratch, try building a well formed *cantus* around the following skeleton. Length, starting pitch, penultimate pitch, ending pitch, and climax have been provided. Create a smooth, consonant melodic line that exemplifies the characteristics listed above. Click the staff to hear the melody. Be sure to listen each time you make a change.
