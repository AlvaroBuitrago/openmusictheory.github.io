title: Form in pop/rock music – Formal containers and module structures
---


## Formal Containers

### Phrase

A phrase is a musical unit that typically lasts for four bars and includes one line of poetry for its lyrical content. Phrases are designated by lower-case letters.

### Module

In pop/rock music, a *module* typically spans between 8 and 24 bars and includes 2–4 phrases. (Some auxiliary modules may contain a single phrase.) A module presents a single [formal function](popRockForm-functions) (such as A, B, C, V, P, etc.) and presents a complete 2-, 3-, or 4-part pattern. Modules typically set a stanza of lyrics.

Module boundaries are usually made apparent by poetic structure (end of a group of rhyming lines—couplet or stanza) or surface features of the song (clear rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic arrival; change in instrumentation or volume; return to beginning of a previously heard module; etc.).

*All module definitions are based on Jason Summach's (2012) dissertation, "Form in Top-20 Rock Music, 1955–89."*

### Primary module

"A module that contains a song’s principal materials" (Summach, p. 322), such as the title text or the most memorable or climactic music. Primary modules exhibit strophe function (A) or chorus function (C). Formal cycles always end with the primary module for the song type (Summach, p. 50).

### Secondary module

"A core module that directs attention towards or provides relief from the song’s primary modules” (Sumach, p. 322). Secondary modules exhibit bridge function (B), verse function (V), prechorus function (P), or postchorus function (Z).

### Core module

Any primary or secondary module (Summach, p. 321).

### Auxiliary module

A non-core module, such as I, J, O, or X (Summach, p. 321).

### Cycle

"The characteristic succession of modules in a song form, ending with the song’s primary module type” (Summach, p. 321). A cycle contains one or more modules, always in the same order (though sometimes with one or more modules omitted, especially toward the end of a song). A strophic song’s cycle is {A}. A 32-bar song’s cycle is {AABA}. A verse-chorus song’s cycle is typically {VC} or {VPC}. Curly brackets {} are used to refer to cycles (to differentiate them from names of song form types).


## Module structures

### Two-part (aa’)

A module is two-part when the phrases that make up the module can be grouped into a first half and a second half. In two-part modules, the second half is usually based on the same music as the first half, and thus it is labeled *aa’*. Often these two halves begin the same but have different endings, participating in an antecedent-consequent (weak → strong) relationship.

### Two-part – ab

Very rarely a module’s phrases can be grouped into two clear halves based on different music. Such a module is labeled *ab*.

### Three-part – aa’b

A module containing three phrases is a three-part module. If the first two phrases are based on the same music, the module is labeled *aa’b* (12-bar blues progressions are the most common example of a three-part *aa’b* module).

### Three-part – abb’

If the second and third phrases in a three-part module are based on the same music, the module is labeled *abb’*.

### Four-part – srdc

A module composed of four phrases often contains a sentential structure (presentation → continuation → cadential/conclusion). In pop/rock music, such a structure typically states a basic musical idea in the first phrase, restates it in the second, provides contrasting material in the third phrase (often employing fragmentation, acceleration of harmonic rhythm, and movement away from tonic harmony), and concludes in the fourth phrase either with a return to the basic idea and tonic harmony or with still newer material that forms a strong melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic conclusion. Walter Everett has called such a four-phrase sentential structure in pop/rock music *srdc* (statement, restatement/response, departure, conclusion). 

In conventional lettering, an *srdc* module could employ an *aaba* structure (with statement material returning as a restatement and again as the conclusion), or *aabc* structure (where the conclusion material is new). Occasionally *abcd* or *abca* are possible, but only if *b* is a clear response to *a*, not simply new material. 

*srdc* structures tend to divide neatly into halves: *sr* and *dc*.
