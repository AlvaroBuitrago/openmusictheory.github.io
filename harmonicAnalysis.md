================

Analyzing harmony in a piece or passage of music involves more than labeling chords. Even the most basic analysis also involves *interpreting* the way that specific chords and progressions function within the context of a phrase. Ultimately, no analysis is complete until individual musical elements are interpreted in light of the work as a whole and the historical setting in which the piece occurs. But this resource simply walks through the steps of performing a basic harmonic analysis, interpreting each chord and chord progression in light of the musical phrase in which it occurs.

The first step in a harmonic analysis is to *identify phrases*. For the most part, that means beginning by identifying [*cadences*](cadenceTypes.html). However, not every type of phrase ends with a cadence, so sensitivity to theme types is important. In classical isntrumental music, that means listening for [period- and sentence-like structures](classicalThemes.html). In classical or romantic music with text, that means listening in particular for the ends of poetic lines and melodic phrases.

Once you have identified the musical phrases, perform a thoroughbass reduction (bass line with figures above) of each phrase. Below the bass line, write an uninterpreted functional bass symbol for each chord (**T1 T3 S4** etc.). [This handout](Graphics/Handouts/HarmoniesByBassScaleDegree.pdf) can help you determine the functions of chords in the thoroughbass reduction.

Next identify the general harmonic structure of each phrase. Typical phrases in classical music will do one of the following:

- prolong tonic without a cadence (a classical *presentation* phrase, for example)  
- progress toward an authentic cadence (ending with **D5 T1** or **V<sup>(7)</sup> I**)  
- progress toward a half cadence (ending with **D5** or **V<sup>(7)</sup>**)

If the phrase prolongs tonic, the *entire* phrase should be placed within parentheses or curly brackets.

If the phrase ends with a cadence, identify the *cadential progression*. This includes the last chord of the tonic zone, optionally followed by a subdominant chord or zone (most often a single chord), and a required dominant zone (most often a single chord or compound cadence formula). Half-cadence phrases end there. Authentic-cadence phrases continue on to a final tonic zone (usually a singe chord). The **(S) D T** of the cadential progression will always stand on its own as a functional progression, and should never be placed in parentheses or brackets indicating tonic prolongation.

Once the cadential progression is identified, everything before it should be analyzed as tonic prolongation: either parentheses for contrapuntal prolongations or curly brackets for subsidiary progressions. Keep in mind that every non-tonic chord inside those parentheses should have a postscript ("n" for neighbor chord, "p" for passing chord, etc., according to the pattern of the bass voice).
