================

Analyzing harmony in a piece or passage of music involves more than labeling chords. Even the most basic analysis also involves *interpreting* the way that specific chords and progressions function within the context of a phrase. Ultimately, no analysis is complete until individual musical elements are interpreted in light of the work as a whole and the historical setting in which the piece occurs. But this resource simply walks through the steps of performing a basic harmonic analysis, interpreting each chord and chord progression in light of the musical phrase in which it occurs.

The first step in a harmonic analysis is to *identify phrases*. For the most part, that means beginning by identifying [*cadences*](cadenceTypes.html). However, not every type of phrase ends with a cadence, so sensitivity to theme types is important. In classical isntrumental music, that means listening for [period- and sentence-like structures](classicalThemes.html). In classical or romantic music with text, that means listening in particular for the ends of poetic lines and melodic phrases.

Once you have identified the musical phrases, perform a thoroughbass reduction (bass line with figures above) of each phrase. Below the bass line, write an uninterpreted functional bass symbol for each chord (**T1 T3 S4** etc.).

Next identify the general harmonic structure of each phrase. Typical phrases in classical music will do one of the following:

- prolong tonic without a cadence (a classical *presentation* phrase, for example)  
- progress toward an authentic cadence (ending with **D5 T1** or **V<sup>(7)</sup> I**)  
- progress toward a half cadence (ending with **D5** or **V<sup>(7)</sup>**)

If the phrase prolongs tonic, the *entire* phrase should be placed within parentheses or curly brackets.

If the phrase ends with a cadence, identify the *cadential progression*.
