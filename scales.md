A scale is a succession of pitches ascending or descending in steps. A half step (H) consists of two adjacent pitches on the keyboard. A whole step (W) consists of two half steps. Usually, the pitches in a scale are each notated with different letter names, though this isn't always possible or desirable. 

### The Chromatic Scale ###

### The major scale ###

A major scale, a sound with which you are undoubtedly familiar, consists of eight whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-W-H-W-W-W-H. The first pitch of the scale, called the *tonic*, is the pitch upon which the rest of the scale is based. When the scale ascends, the tonic heard an octave higher at the end.
