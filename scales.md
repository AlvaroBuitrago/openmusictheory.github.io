A scale is a succession of pitches ascending or descending in steps. A half step (H) consists of two adjacent pitches on the keyboard. A whole step (W) consists of two half steps. Usually, the pitches in a scale are each notated with different letter names, though this isn't always possible or desirable. 

### The Chromatic Scale ###

A scale consisting entirely of half steps. The chromatic scale uses every pitch on the keyboard within a single octave. Here is the chromatic scale that spans the pitches C4 through C5.

### The major scale ###

A major scale, a sound with which you are undoubtedly familiar, consists of eight whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-W-H-W-W-W-H. The first pitch of the scale, called the *tonic*, is the pitch upon which the rest of the scale is based. When the scale ascends, the tonic is repeated at the end an octave higher.

Here is the D major scale. It is called the "D major scale" because the pitch D is the *tonic* and is heard at both ends of the scale.

A natural minor scale consists of eight whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-H-W-W-H-W-W.
