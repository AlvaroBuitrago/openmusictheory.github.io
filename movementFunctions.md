title: Higher-level classical formal functions
---

{{ page.title }}
================

This resource describes formal functions in classical pieces that operate on a higher level than the *presentation*, *continuation*, and *cadential* functions of small classical themes. (See [Classical theme functions](themeFunctions.html). These higher-level sometimes govern large themes, and often entire movements, including minuets and sonata-form movements.

The functions described in this resource include *core* functions, like *exposition*, *contrasting middle*, and *recapitulation* functions; as well as *auxiliary* functions, like *introduction*
