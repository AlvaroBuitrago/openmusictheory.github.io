title: Thematic Structure in the Classical Style

{{ page.title }}
================

Thematic structure in the classical style is incredibly diverse and interesting. It's been studied by music theorists for more than two centuries. Older music theorists, like Joseph Riepel (1709-1782), Heinrich Christoph Koch (1749-1816), and Jérôme-Joseph de Momigny (1762-1842), were writing about thematic structure in music of their time, and their discussions have continued to inform musicians understandings of thematic structure.

We are concentrating on thematic structure in the classical style, as opposed to the Baroque or ROmantic eras, for two primary reasons. First, it has been most discussed and is best understood. Because a wealth of writing has dealt with classical cadence, motivic structure, and phrase organization, we are well positioned to approach the subject systematically. Of course, our systematic approach should not be taken to mean that we are able to explain everything. Even among music theorists that have developed robust theories of classical form (Hugo Riemann, for example), flexible analysis is still important. Second, understanding thematic structure in the classical style will give us a way into the most important instrumental forms of the time: not just [sonata form](sonata.html), but [minuet](minuet.html) and [rondo](rondo.html) as well. Those forms, along with the thematic structure and organization within, continue to be important to composers today.

Our descriptions of classical thematic structure are borrowed primarily from William Caplin, whose brilliant treatise *Classical Form*, borrows ideas from Arnold Schoenberg and Erwin Ratz. Caplin's explanations of the various types of theme ([sentence](sentence.html), [period](period.html), [hybrid](hybrid.html), [binary](binary.html)) found in the classical style is the most systematic and practical. 

Many music theorists have studied deviations from the standards types of theme. The two short resources here, on [external](externalExpansions.html) and [internal](internalExpansions.html), borrow from William Rothstein's *Phrase Rhythm in Tonal Music.*
