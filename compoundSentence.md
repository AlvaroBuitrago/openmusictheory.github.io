## Compound sentence ##

The compound (or 16-bar) sentence expands both the presentation and continuation phrases of a regular [sentence](sentence.html) to a typical length of eight bars each. 

Each (2-bar) basic idea (BI) of the presentation phrase is replaced by a (4-bar) compound basic idea (CBI) in the expanded presentation. The resulting (typically 8-bar) presentation still has no cadence, but simply prolongs tonic.

The expanded continuation phrase is somewhat looser in proportion and in length. A "typical" continuation in this theme would have approximately four bars of continuation function followed by four bars of cadential function (an expanded cadential progression).

A prototypical example of a compound sentence is Mozart's [Trio for Piano, Clarinet, and Viola, K. 498](http://erato.uvt.nl/files/imglnks/usimg/3/32/IMSLP65681-PMLP133432-Mozart_Werke_Breitkopf_Serie_17_KV498_Piano.pdf), I., mm. 1â€“16.

Note that *bar length is not the important issue* when deciding whether a theme is a regular sentence or a compound sentence. Sometimes a regular sentence is written down in a fast duple meter, and it takes up 16 bars. At other times, a compound theme is set to such a slow tempo that it takes only 8 bars (like the compound period in Mozart's K. 332, above). The key difference between the regular sentence and the compound sentence is that the regular sentence begins with two basic ideas and the compound sentence begins with two *compound basic ideas*. Even that distinction will, at times, seem like splitting hairs, though at other times it will be quite obvious. Use your best judgment based on the musical features that you find to be the most salient.
