title: Improvising a sentence with galant schemata
---

The [classical sentence](sentence.html) lends itself well to *galant* schemata. In fact, we have labeled many of the schemata on our [summary page](schemataSummary.html) as "presentation" or "continuation" schemata. Many four-stage schemata tend to appear with the melodic configuration that Caplin calls *statement–response*—a basic idea and its varied repetition.

Take the opening theme from Haydn's Piano Sonata in G Major, Hob. XVI:27, third movement.

Bars 1–4 (the presentation phrase) give an embellishment of the Meyer schema. Note the two-bar basic idea that is repeated in mm. 3–4, transposed up a step (for the most part).

Bars 5–6 (beginning the continuation phrase) give an embellishment of the modulating Passo Indietro schema. This is followed by a **II<sup>6</sup> V<sup>7</sup> I** cadence in the key of the dominant. (Of course, it goes by so fast, it can easily sound like a half cadence in the home key.)

Our beginning improvisations will not be nearly as elaborate as Haydn's composition, but note a few features that will be helpful to mimic:

- The Meyer's typical melody notes come on each downbeat (stage 1 – bar 1, etc.).  
- The Meyer's typical melody notes for stages 1 and 3 also come at the end of the bar, immediately preceding their counterparts in bars 2 and 4.  
- Though the harmonic rhythm remains the same, the switch from presentation schema to continuation schema is matched by a change from two-bar melodic "chunks" to one-bar melodic chunks. (This is the *fragmentation* that is common to continuation phrases.)  
- The continuation phrase follows well from the presentation phrase rhythmically and harmonically, but there is no obvious motivic connection between the two phrases.  
- The cadence is relatively formulaic.

In those ways, this theme is a model example for our simple improvisations: highlight the schema's typical melody notes on the downbeats and/or across the barline between mm. 1 and 2, mm. 3 and 4; use a more original melodic idea at the beginning and get more formulaic as you progress towards the final cadence; etc.

Following is a video that goes into more detail about tricky situations and specific techniques that may come up when using these schemata to improvise a sentence. This video focuses on the presentation phrase, using schemata like the Meyer or the Jupiter.
