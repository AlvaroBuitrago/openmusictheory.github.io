title: Phrase Deviations

{{ page.title }}
================

In classical music, phrase lengths are quite often duple. Deviating from those lengths is a principle means of subverting expectation, creating tension, and providing musical interest. These deviations are very diverse, and have been occupied the interests of music theorists for centuries.

We will concentrate our attention on two on *phrase extension*, *phrase expansion*, and *phrase compression*.

##Phrase Extension##

Cadential deferral
	
In the terminating phrase of a theme (whether consequent or continuation), if the cadence at the expected moment is weak--IAC or DC--or if the cadence is evaded, the entire terminating phrase may be attempted again iso as to create a stronger cadence, usually a PAC.

In this example, measure 1–8 create a sentence whose basic idea is fragmented in m. 5–6. In m. 8, at the moment of expected cadence, an IAC emerges instead of a PAC. To rectify the problem, the entire continuation is repeated beginning at m. 9 with the fragmentation in the left hand, culminating with a powerful PAC in m. 13.
	
##Phrase Expansion##
	
Often, a phrase or sub-phrase is melodically expanded beyond its normal length. 

Thus, a cadential sub-phrase may take six measures–instead of just two–to complete itself.

**Mozart’s Rondo in F, K. 494**

Here we find an expanded period. An HC in m. 6 is followed by a consequent phrase (note the return of the complete basic idea in m. 7) that ends with a PAC in m. 12. The theme’s exceptional length is caused by an expansion of  the basic idea. The second half of the basic idea (m. 2) is echoed in m. 3, creating a three-bar basic idea. The contrasting idea follows and also requires three bars to complete.

Note the difference as compared to the Beethoven. That example involved a cadence. This example’s expansion comes as the result of a melodic expansion created by repetition. But in both cases, one could imagine erasing some of the music to turn the expanded phrase into an eight-bar unit.
